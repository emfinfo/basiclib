A Java library with some basic methods (most are static methods) for all your needs when you are starting an application. Comments are in french in the source code. You find classes and methods for :
- date and time (DateTimeLib class)
- file reading helper (see files in ch.jcsinfo.file package)
- some mathematical methods (MathLib class)
- some generic models (see files in ch.jcsinfo.models)
- some printing classes (see files in ch.jcsinfo.printing package)
- some system classes (see files in ch.jcsinfo.system package)
- some util classes (callback, simple cypher, prefs manager, screen info, etc)

You can download and open this project in NetBeans 8.1. I'ts a Java 8 maven project. So, dependencies are loaded automaticly from maven central. There are some test classes. They must work.
